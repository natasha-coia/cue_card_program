# Cue Card Program
## Description
This program can be used to read through and edit sets of cue cards. The sets of cue cards are .txt files, with each cue card being a line in the file and 
the front/back of a cue card being separated by a "/". When reading through cue cards, they are generated randomly from the topic .txt file using the python
module random. The list of topics is settled on through using the os module, excluding the files that are known to not be topics.
